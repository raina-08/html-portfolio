<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All TIme</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>It is the perfect misture of romance and disaster. Leonardo DiCaprio is Yummy. I have watched this movie a million times. </p>

<h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p>I don't need to say anything. All avengers in one place. Avengers Assemble. Masterpiece.</p>

<h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
<p>I don't like musicals but this movie hits different. I know all the songs by heart. Hugh jackman, Zandaya and Zac Efron are brilliant. The soundtrack, the story, the visuals, eveyrthing is top notch.</p>
